What is that define society? I mean our society?
We live in a society that requires us to have it all. Yeah, I mean a cell phone, all the social media you can think of and maybe a personal computer, a Gmail account and so on.

Oh, I forgot. A home, a mortgage, a car, a full-time job. Our dream? Leave out that damn slash! I mean the slash that, once again, define us.

What do you do? this is the most common icebreaking question I heard this past month. The answer? “nanny/student/part-time job at Human, Inc./lover”.

I’m 25 years old and I still have too many slashes. I asked the same to my mother, thinking about what she was doing at my same age. She told me: almost graduate but with a job coming. 

livin’ it!

Anyhow, let’s get back to where we were.
We live in a society where what we put online is valuable in order to state who we are, what we are, what we want, how we think. to be seen we must have a presence online.
For example, when we apply to a job search engine online we must add at least one social media profile. What? What if I don’t have a social media profile?

Yes, I do know that WhatsApp is a social media now. Yes, I do have WhatsApp, but that’s only because my parents are still alive and they use it to talk to me in an easier way, duh.

I used to have Snapchat, Periscope, Facebook, Instagram, Youtube.

But then something happened: I saw Black Mirror. I read some books/articles and I tried to think with my own mind.

Black Mirror showed me a parallel world in which people died because of social media. People suffered because of social media. You can tell me it’s just a tv show. Hey, open your eyes and look closely because it’s not. It shows us our reality in another way. You cannot forget an episode. You will always relate it to your life (don’t deny).

I used to love watching other people’s lives, knowing all about them. but then I thought: why do I have to know she’s having a baby, or they are moving, or hey she sells stickers online?

My life is still the same, even if I don’t know that. But as for now, I can tell the story of at least 10 children and 8 families. I’ve never seen them in real life but it’s kinda like I’m in it, all along their #k/m followers.

It’s almost the same on Facebook. Why do I have to tell all the people I have as friends what’s going on in my life? Facebook will own it all, and it’s not a secret. It’s all written in the Terms&Conditions no one reads because they are too small.

Why do I have to let marketing agencies led my life, my choices and my orders online? I will not do that in the future. Because, at the end of the day, I will have the same couple of friends, the same Family, and the same pillow to sleep on.

Last but not least, the microphone on your phone.

Ever got that message? “Allow the microphone to change the filter on this photo on Instagram”. Wait, what?

Here it is, folks. You allow that microphone because the pic is soo good you can’t even and there you are, walking on the street with your mic open.

Yes, they hear you. And they study you and they build your own image online so you will buy this and not that.

So, keep in mind: you have your own life, with your people and your hobbies and so on. No need to tell it to the world.

Wait, nope.

Well, you don’t need it but..there’s always a but.
If you want to be part of something you must be on Facebook because that’s how people talk these days. “You can’t be part of this project if you are not on Facebook”.

Oh come on.

Yes, you will have to make a choice: should I stay on Facebook or leave the project?
Ain’t easy. Not at all.

We can’t, tho, let social media led our lives. We must stand for what we believe is right.

Real friends will stick around even if you don’t have all the social media known to men on your phone.

This is just a rant here, but I will write an article about it soon.
