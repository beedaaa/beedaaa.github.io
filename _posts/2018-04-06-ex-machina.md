Let's talk about movies. 
I love watching movies and I do love talking about movies. 
I even write for a web magazine about culture in general, movies in particular.
Today I wanna talk abnout a movie I've recently watched, yeah it's pretty good indeed.
Ex Machina features a guy who wins a competition at his workplace..he can go to his boss's house and wander around. 
no, wait. 
let's start from the beginning.
I was the kind of person who watches a lot of movies, because I ain't went out a lot back in the high school days, my best friend was a movie
aholic and so was I.
she used to took me to the movies all the times and talked about movies a lot. 
she is in the movie business right now, what a surprise. 
As for now tho I prefer to chose quality movies instead of quantity movies. I mean, yeah, I watch loads of them but not that many anymore.
Now that I wanna be a programmer, I like to watch movies about tech and stuff like that, to learn the language and so on.
Ex Machina is a great movie to start with. It talks about the desolation of human society, programming in general and how robot are used to
learn more about humans themselves.
How can a robot teach us how to love, how to be happy and how to stay in the world?
Can a robot overcome us and drive us crazy?
this movie answer this ques
