Let’s start from the beginning.
I do not know why but I am not able to laugh. It’s awful.

By the way, when someone points out that The Simpsons are funny I have no idea what they are talking about and it takes me ageeees to get puns.

Ok, moving on. BoJack Horseman make me laugh A LOT.. I mean, waht?

Seriously, it’s so damn funny I can’t even. It’s dark humor tho, not that kind of stuff you should really laugh at. It’s kinda racists and so on.

It all began back in 2014 when Raphael Bob-Waksberg decided it was time to draw a cartoon and did draw a cartoon. And here we are, 49 episodes later with abdominal cramps caused by laughing too much.

BoJack is that kind of tv hero that reincarnates a mix of other tv heroes in a funny way. In this case, he is a mix of Draper, Underwood and the Sopranos.
He is the kind of guy who used to have it all and now, 20 years later, have nothing. That kind of American famous person, you know?

Anyway, this is not a cartoon for children, it’s too rude. That is why is different from other kinds of cartoons.

For example, take Rick and Morty: it does have a social/political/environmental meaning but children can watch it and understand it (kinda). Or Adventure Time (oh maaaan, so good): they will never know how those guys come up with the idea, but they can actually watch it and have fun doing it. It’s all the same for Ed, Edd and Eddy.

Going back to BoJack: he is loved because he is just like us. He is us in the real world. That is why even I laugh when I see it.

So real, explicit and funny at the same time.

My anti-spoiler alert voice in my head is telling me to stop because I can’t spoil BoJack, just kidnap a friend, chill out and watch it, it’s on Netflix (even for free, you know).
