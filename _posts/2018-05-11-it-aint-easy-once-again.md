Okay, you gotta know this.

God, whatever God you want, created Life. And so on. You know the drill.

But He created a guide too. If you think about it every religion whatsoever has a Holy Book, a guide, a dictionary of Life. Bible, Q’aran and so on. I ain’t have seen a religion without a guidebook.

What do we use guides for? Well, to find answers. And Why do we need to find them? Because we have problems.

God created Life but he made it hard. Imagine a perfect life, so boring.

Okay well, life ain’t easy but we can work to make it easier.

God gave everyone of us an ability.

An ability to sing, paint, help, listen, believe, run, walk, fly.

He also gave us pain. I am in so much pain right now but I’m still alive and, as for now, it’s enough.

Reading this help book called the Bible I’ve learn one thing: there is a purpose. I was made to do something good at one point in my life.

I don’t know what yet, but it will arrive.

One day I will wake up and just know.

And so will you.

Ram Ram.
