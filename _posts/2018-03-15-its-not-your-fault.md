Sometimes we do feel like we have something wrong in your head. We all have phobias but it’s okay.

What do you think? That God made us all perfect? Nah, no way. We all have something that bothers us, that make us feel like we ain’t worth it.

But hey, life is something we can’t deal with having only tears in our eyes, we have to find a way to overcome fear and pain and loneliness.

Do you agree with that?

Anyway, it’s not your fault if you need a break from life itself, it’s not your fault if you need to stay alone for a while.

Sometimes a person just needs it.

But when you need a break, please do it right. Take some time to think about what you need to do and just do it.

First of all, tho, tell to all the people around you that you are going to do that because you don’t need to worry them. Besides, they will be grateful because they know it.

Then take a long bubble bath, put on some jazz music or the music you like the most and just relax. Put your phone away and wait for it to happen.

Happiness, or at least a sense of total relaxation of the body.

After the bath do what you feel like and go to work if you have to but don’t let the workaholic anxiety hit you.

If you have a good friend (NOT BOYFRIEND/GF), invite him/her over to do stupid, silly stuff like dancing to the Oasis in your underwear.

Do not listen to sad music. Yes, I love dearly the Joy Division, but I know they are sad, darkish and we all know the end of Ian so please avoid that, don’t be sadder than you already are.

Go to a fancy restaurant and eat your fave meal, talk to strangers, read a book cover to cover and then go the movies so late you have to walk home and discover new places.

If you want to, can you share with me your happiness routine?

I would love to know how people deal with sadness!

Love you all, you are worth it.
