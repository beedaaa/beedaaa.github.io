okay, so. a lot of times I told myself I had to start over. Like, for real girl. You need to change that, or this. or whatever. But, to be honest, it never really worked. To this day, at 26, I still don’t believe in myself fully. it is wrong. so damn wrong.

you have to believe in yourself. anyway, this week I have received loads of porte in faccia which means pies in the face, a door in the face. I hit rock bottom. mentally, at least. I thought I couldn’t do it. I still do, actually.

I was stuck thinking I only had some kind of friends, a kind of life I used to like. I felt comfy but not anymore. Now I feel alone, stupid in a way, and stuck. so stuck.

Now I have, I want, I need to change all of this. I will take all the advantage I can on the trip to Vienna in order to become a better me. 

I want to fit in, you know?
