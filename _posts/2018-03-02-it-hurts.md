You know what?
It hurts a lot to know, I mean, to realize, you are not doing enough.
It hurts to know you don’t have that many friends anymore.
It hurts to know you forget about stuff sometimes.
It hurts to don’t feel okay with yourself. Do I need to explain how depression works? Nah, because it works differently for everyone.

There’s a moment in which I do feel something and then I realize it means you can be depressed even if you don’t have the courage to sleep because of nightmares because you are afraid something is gonna happen to you and you won’t open your eyes in the morning.

What if I will not be able to love anymore?
What if I will lose my wish to end up in a good, healthy place?

Sometimes I don’t have the ability to talk, I mean yeah I can talk, but I don’t want to.
Yo, guys, I talk waaay too much. Everybody knows that.

Sometimes I just feel worthless. I mean nothing. I feel nothing. I’m not even able to say I love you.

Man, that’s hard.

But at the same time, I do know I will hurt my mama, my Family in general if I feel this way. Thank God I am a movie lover, I saw loads of movies with broken-hearted mothers. I will not be able to do that to my mother, I am not capable.

So I will stand up, look in the mirror, wash my face and move on. And, yes, I will ask for help.

Don’t wait for the International Day of Mental Health to seek help guys. DO IT NOW.

And drink water. it’s an actual life saver.
